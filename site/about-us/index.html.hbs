          <p>Ever since Alex's first game system, the Super NES he always dreamed of not just playing games, but creating them. After hearing stories of the industry, and realizing that the average game developer works on a huge team and has no say in the direction of the project he became discouraged and forgot this dream. In 2012 Alex watched the film 'Indie Game: The Movie' and realized that making games is possible after all, as an indie developer! Alex now creates all the art for Two Scoop Games, and is very happy to be living his dream.</p>
